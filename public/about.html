<h1 id="me">ABOUT ME</h1>
<p>My name is Jane, am from Enuge sate Nigeria. i grew up with my three siblings and also my parents, but at a point, i started living with my aunty.
  i schooled in Ekulu primary school, and my secondry school at Girls High School Uwani Enugu. i was not a fan of making friends  when i was in school, 
  am always on my own, even during break time in shool, i will watch other childern play but i wouldn't wish to join them.
  I grew up in a background where childern are allowed to do what they want and go wherever they want to go,
  but in our case, is not like that knowing the kind of parents i had.my parents were over protective knowing the kind of environment we are in.
  i moved over to my aunty's house at the age of 12, where i completed my primary and secondry schhol and i got exposed to many things 
  and got a lot of experience that is helping me up till now.
</p>

<p>Fastfoward to now, am in Nnamdi Azikiwe University, am currently in school studying pure and industral physic in industral physic department,
  physical science faculty. am still not a social person even in high school, and all the student activites we have in school, i bearly go to any of them,
 when it comes to my study, i try as much as possible to study my book to get good grade in school, so sometimes, i go to nigt class or form a reading 
 team during the day time after lectures at the library. and it helps me so much, cos i will get to sit with people, know their opinon and also
  get to know their method of reading. 
</p>

<p>One thing about me is that i get myself to learn new things that will help me in life, no matter how hard it is to understand,
 am always happy expericing it.i found it diffcult to express how i feel or commuincate to someone esle, even when i understand the whole thing,
  to pass the knowledge is actually a problem for me but with time, i will learn that. i am a fan of music and entertainment like drama or dancing
 I love me bcos no matter hw things get to worse, i don't give up easily.
